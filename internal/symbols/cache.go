// Persisting the symbol index.
//
// Extraction is the expensive thing this server does. Measured against a
// real 187-repository workspace: a workspace scan answers in 10–60 ms,
// while the first cross-repository symbol lookup takes 6.9 seconds — and
// because the in-memory cache holds only a couple of dozen repositories,
// most of that is paid again on the next query, and all of it again after
// a restart. A client that launches the server per session pays it every
// session.
//
// # Why a file per repository, and not a database
//
// The obvious answer is SQLite, and it is the wrong one here. corral holds
// eleven direct dependencies and a hand-maintained SBOM that CI checks;
// the pure-Go SQLite driver is an order of magnitude larger than corral
// itself, and the fast one is CGO, which ADR-0006 already rules out. None
// of what a database offers is needed: there are no joins, no
// transactions, no concurrent writers to reconcile, and no queries beyond
// "give me this repository's symbols".
//
// What is needed is that a stale entry can never be served, and that one
// corrupt file cannot break the index. A file per repository gives both:
// invalidation is per repository, and a file that fails to parse is a
// cache miss rather than a failure.
//
// Entries are gzipped. Uncompressed, a real 187-repository workspace
// produced 53 MB of cache — defensible but rude for something that lives
// in a user's home directory, and the content is JSON with the same dozen
// field names repeated a million times, which is close to the ideal case
// for a compressor. Decompression is far cheaper than the extraction it
// replaces.
//
// # Why the fingerprint is trustworthy
//
// A cache hit still walks the repository. The walk is the cheap half of
// extraction and it already stats every file, so the count, the byte
// total and the newest modification time come for free — and every edit
// changes at least one of them. What this cannot detect is an edit that
// leaves the file's size and mtime identical, which requires deliberately
// restoring both; a developer's editor does not do that, and the cost of
// being wrong is a stale line number rather than a wrong file.

// Fingerprint identifies a repository's source content cheaply enough to
// compute on every call.

// memory, or absent — and so a test can drive a cache that fails without
