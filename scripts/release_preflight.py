"""Prove a release can publish, before the tag exists.

Two consecutive releases published their artefacts and then failed:

  v0.0.33  the Homebrew tap refused a direct push (409), because the tap
           protects main with enforce_admins. The cask step ran inside the
           release job, so the failure also skipped the AUR publish and the
           SLSA attestation.
  v0.0.35  the MCP registry rejected server.json (422, "expected length
           <= 100"): a description had been rewritten from 91 characters to
           143. Correct prose, and unpublishable.

Neither was reachable by the existing dry run, because a dry run *skips
publishing* — and publishing is where both failed. Both were also
discoverable beforehand: the length limit is written down in the schema
server.json already points at, and the job layout is readable in the
workflow.

So this checks the things a tag push would otherwise be the first to try:

  1. server.json validates against its own declared $schema, in full. Not a
     hand-copied list of limits — the registry's own constraints, so a field
     nobody here anticipated is still caught.
  2. Every version reference agrees with the CHANGELOG.
  3. No publisher can take the release down with it. This is the one that
     recurred: after v0.0.33 the cask was moved into its own job, and
     v0.0.35 then failed the same way through a different publisher that had
     been left behind.

Exits non-zero listing everything wrong, rather than stopping at the first.
